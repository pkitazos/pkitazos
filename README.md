### Hello ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a (newly minted) programmer / computing Scientist interested in Programming Languages research
- My Master's project focused on building a proof-of-concept [library](https://github.com/pkitazos/elixir-mpst) for statically typechecking Elixir communications using Multiparty Session Types
- As part of undergrad project I built a system for managing student-project allocations within a university setting. In the following years I continued building out that [web platform](https://github.com/amps-kt/spa) and  that system is currently used at the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow to manage Student-Project and Reader-Project allocations within the School of Computing Science
